## SPARC - AI Personal Assistant (Solo)
- Python based program inspired by personal assistants like JARVIS and EDITH from the Marvel Cinematic Universe
- I wanted to create my own personal assistant with custom protocols and features that would help my daily life - weather information, task automation, message summarization
