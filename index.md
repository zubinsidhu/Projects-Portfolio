# Zubin Sidhu's Project Portfolio

## Waffle - Desktop Social Media App (Team)
- Java based social media app I designed with a team of 4 in CS18000 at Purdue University
- Allows profile creation, DMs, Group chats, friending, blocking, and live messaging using live updates
- Designed with a minimalist interface for easy use and desktop compatibility

## SPARC - AI Personal Assistant (Solo)
- Python based program inspired by personal assistants like JARVIS and EDITH from the Marvel Cinematic Universe
- I wanted to create my own personal assistant with custom protocols and features that would help my daily life - weather information, task automation, message summarization
- SPARC or my Synthetic Personal Assistant and Resource Coordinator was a program I designed to automate various tasks and keep me up to date on certain information
- I am currently working to improve and increase the features SPARC has available as well as design new ways SPARC can help my daily life

## Forecast Fit - AI Weather App (Solo)
- Designed an app from scratch that utilizes weather APIs to get data and recommends the user an outfit for the weather
- Implemented the ability for users to add their wardrobe into the app to get more personalized recommendations
- Users can have discussions with the app as it will use SLMs to handle discussions regarding the weather and how to prepare for it
- Developed idea after experiencing harsh winters in university compared to back home and thought such an app would be handy for users like me who are new to different weather regions than they are used to or are planning for travel

## Fridgy - Expiration Tracking App (Solo)
- Designed an app to help users keep track of food in their fridge to prevent food waste
- Notifies users of food about to expire or food that has been in the fridge for a while to help users finish food rather than wasting it
- Developed the idea after finding myself wasting food in university and has helped me reduce food waste entirely

## AI Glaucoma Detector (Solo)

## Zubin's Dungeon Quest Game (Solo)

## Folder Organizer Script (Solo)
- Python script I developed that sorts files automatically based on file type
- I found it tedious to sort files into folders so developed a script that as long as there was a path to it, you can automate the sorting by whatever name/category desired
